### Following is the methodology for running run_Analysis.r
* Save this code to a location<root> on your computer. e.g. C:\Downloads
* Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
* Unzip the above file to "UCI HAR Dataset" Folder under <root>
* Create a folder called data under <root>
* Open an R Session and set working directory to <root>
* Call run_Analysis.r
### Following is the methodology for running run_Analysis_PartA.r 
* Save this code to a location<root> on your computer. e.g. C:\Downloads
* Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
* Unzip the above file to "UCI HAR Dataset" Folder under <root>
* Create a folder called data under <root>
* Open an R Session and set working directory to <root>
* Call run_Analysis_PartA.r
### run_Analysis_PartA.r creates a merge of test and train data,renames the columns and labels the activity. stores an rda file to <root>\data location
### Run run_Analysis_PartB.r in the same session. If you relaunch a new R session then 
* set your working directory to location where Run run_Analysis_PartB.r is stored
* Call run_Analysis_PartB.r
